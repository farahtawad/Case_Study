## Overview and Origin
---
**International Business Machines**  commonly known as **IBM** is a software company that offers and produces hardware, software cloud-based services and cognitive computing. Founded by Charles Ranlett Finn in 1911, IBM is one of the top information technology companies in the world. IBM was incorporated in New York State as the *Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company* then renamed in 1924. The primary focus of IBM is to offer companies various technical solutions to help increase effeciency. In fact, it is a leader in providing SaaS (software as a service) solutions to 47 out of 50 fortune 500 companies including Caterpillar, Lindt and Princess Cruises.

Of the many innovations that IBM offers, Regulatory Technology or RegTech is transforming regulatory compliance for financial institutions. After the recession in 2008, managing risk and tracking compliance became the prime focus of many financial institutions in the United States. As a result, IT companies such as IBM leverged their expertise in artificial intellegince to come up with innovative ways to help financial institutions meet their compliance requirements at a reduced cost and effort. 

Furthermore, on May 1st, 2019 IBM partnered with Thomas Reuters, an established Canadian IT company, in which both firms were able to gain client trust in RegTech to grow its funding. Since 2017, funds for RegTech have doubled from $1.9bn to almost $5bn in the following years. IBM continues to invest and fund new solutions by using part of the revenue it generates offering SaaS products and gaining customer intreset.
