## Overview and Origin

**International Business Machines**  commonly known as **IBM** is a software company that offers and produces hardware, software cloud-based services and cognitive computing<sup>1</sup>. Founded by Charles Ranlett Finn in 1911, IBM is one of the top information technology companies in the world. IBM was incorporated in New York State as the *Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company* then renamed in 1924. The primary focus of IBM is to offer companies various technical solutions to help increase effeciency. In fact, it is a leader in providing SaaS (software as a service) solutions to 47 out of 50 fortune 500 companies including Caterpillar, Lindt and Princess Cruises<sup>1</sup>.

Of the many innovations that IBM offers, Regulatory Technology or RegTech is transforming regulatory compliance for financial institutions. After the recession in 2008, managing risk and tracking compliance became the prime focus of many financial institutions in the United States<sup>1</sup>. As a result, IT companies such as IBM leverged their expertise in artificial intellegince to come up with innovative ways to help financial institutions meet their compliance requirements at a reduced cost and effort. 

Further, on May 1st, 2019 IBM partnered with Thomas Reuters, an established Canadian IT company, in which both firms were able to gain client trust in RegTech to grow its funding. Since 2017, funds for RegTech have doubled from $1.9bn to almost $5bn in the following years<sup>2</sup>. IBM continues to invest and fund new solutions by using part of the revenue it generates offering SaaS products and gaining customer intreset<sup>3</sup>.  


## Business Activities

Accordingly, IBM states that global banks have paid more than $320 billion in fines and penalties since 2008<sup>5</sup>. These penalties were due to gaps in compliance and risk regulations. In the hope that they can survive the increasing demand on regulatory compliance, financial institutions figured the only way to do that is by hiring more compliance experts. This of course would result in the increase of overhead costs. However, IBM developed a way for banks to stay on top of their compliance requirements while also remaining cost-effecient. RegTech promises to cut tedious manual hours, eliminate human errors, and save financial institutions millions of USD in resources. For Example, one of the many funtions RegTech offers is helping banks steamline the process of gathering security analytics and KYC verifications. 

IBM offers RegTech to all businesses requiring regulatory compliance assistance. However, the primary client for RegTech is financial instutitons because of their high demand for risk mitigation after the recession. Currently, the financial markets of the United States are the largest in the world<sup>6</sup>. The most crucial advantage that IBM holds over other RegTech vendors, is extensive knowledge of financial markets and business clients. In fact, IBM is one of the oldest information technology companies in the United States and well-versed in automation solutions and AI. 

In light of IBM having the advantage of historical IT market knowledge, the technology behind RegTech is developed to fit each client's business needs. IBM employs cognitive computing tools such as machine learning and natural processing. According to their expertise, "cognitive systems can read as many as 800 million pages per second in natural language"<sup>5</sup>. This type of innovation can help expedite the manual effort spent on processing bulks of documents related to compliance. Not only that, but the way they are implementing this technology is by monitoring consumer trend and gathering data insights to help process structured and unstructured data likewise<sup>5</sup>. 

## Landscape
Not only does IBM dominate the information technology market but it is also a huge contributer to the financial industry. Specifically, IBM is part of the enterprise financial software domain. Coupled with offering regulatory compliance technology solutions, it also offers blockchain applications and cloud computing innovations for clients in various financial fields.  

To say the least, the financial industry has seen a huge disruption throughout the years caused by new technology developed by IT firms such as IBM. Finance and accounting as we once knew them are no longer lingering in big banks. For instance, 5 or 10 years ago we were spending hours manually entering customer transactions on a simplified ledger system. Today with the introduction of cloud services, blockchain, and AI big firms such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and BNY Melon are investing millions of dollars on automating these processes. Similarily risk management and compliance is still a highly manual effort which could be improved with the growth of RegTech innovations in the upcoming years<sup>7</sup>. 

## Results

As mentioned before, IBM is one of the top IT firms in the world. Specifically, IBM ranks #14 in Forbes 100 best digital companies in the world behind firms like Microsoft, Apple and Intel. Many of these successful digital firms measure their success through the success of their innovations. A technology company is considered as successful as their developed product or service. In like manner, IBM thrives on developing the most effecient and advanced technologies that would save their clients time and resources. However, if success was to be measured in quantifiable data then the succces of these firms would depend on how much revenue they generate. For IBM, the revenue it generated in 2019 was ~$78bn which did not land it on the fortune 500 list of 2020<sup>10</sup>. 


## Recommendations

Although IBM has been providing outstanding services to its clients, there will always be a room for improvement. In fact, many companies today are advancing their technical capabilities and locally developing many of the technologies that IBM offers. One suggestion that could gain IBM competitve advantage is acquiring social media networking services. Microsoft Corporation, one of IBM's fiercest competitors, acquired LinkedIn in 2016<sup>9</sup>, which resulted in diversifying its reach and client portfolio. With IBM's industry knowledge, acquiring a social network can provide it with a huge competitve advantage.  

Similar to Microsoft's expansion into social networking, this would allow the opportunity for IBM to merge some of its software products and introduce more advanced functions to the social network consumers. Not only that, but attracting a larger client pool results in more revenue. 

Ultimately, social media platforms are built on LAMP (software bundle) stacks, and improved using APIs (Application Networking Interfaces). Recently with the emerging of advanced machine learning and artificial intellegince, established social networking services such as Facebook are able to add more features to their platforms. Since IBM is an expert in machine learning and API it would be a great technology to use for this recommendation. 

Last but not least, the field of technology in general has a massive and diverse reach. As technology is never static and always evolving, IBM's innovations will continue to evolve as well. RegTech is only one example of a rising innovation that is expected to dominate the market in the years to come.
